It's the middle of summer, two months into my internship away from [Desmond](http://desmond.mit.edu/) and the rest of my friends at MIT, and I've found myself with an abundance of time on my hands. Outside of work, I spend my days climbing, reading, cooking, and mindlessly scrolling through Twitter and Reels. It's amazing how much time there is beyond that when I don't spend my evenings psetting or surrounded by my very energetic dormmates. One good thing about taking a break from the firehose of MIT and being on my own is that I can finally write down some thoughts. During the semester, I hardly have any time for this. So, I made this blog!


I hope to post here, when I have time, about my life, technical notes on math, CS, and AI, and topics in philosophy, culture, and tech that I find interesting.

It's not the first time I've experienced solitary boredom, nor my first attempt to journal my thoughts, but this is my first blog! I've always been hesitant to share my writing publicly because, whenever I reviewed my own writing or that of my peers—whether college essays or blog posts—I couldn't help but cringe. Any sort of essay-style writing by anyone my age always seemed somewhat mundane, from either a lack of originality or an immature style, especially when compared to my favorite essayists like [Erik Hoel](https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/the-gossip-trap), [Gwern](https://gwern.net/narrowing-circle), and [Paul Graham](https://www.paulgraham.com/genius.html), or to accomplished writers of past generations.

I think it's just really hard to find truly unique and substantive things to say with the relatively limited life experiences, pieces of media consumed, and technical knowledge that 18-year-olds have. From those three rough categories of "things that inspire writing," we've all had the same trite self-reflections after our first year away from home, we can all analyze our favorite required readings "The Great Gatsby" and "1984" and relate them to modern issues, and we can all draft formulaic think pieces on whether AI will kill us all. Young people's training sets share a lot of overlap and are usually pretty shallow compared to those of accomplished writers (or other producers of media—after all, this applies not just to writing but to any form of creation from art to scientific research).

All that said, I think this line of reasoning has been a major obstacle for me. Whenever I started to write or create something new, I dismissed it, thinking there was no point since it had already been done before. I was too quick to dismiss ideas that didn't feel entirely original. Recently, in perhaps a "trite self-reflection" of my own, I've started to accept that *this is perfectly fine*. Restricting myself to only pursuing ideas that are "truly original" just stops me from producing anything before I even begin. I think it's okay to write about things that have already been written about, to do things that have already been done.

Sharing one's pure ideas *is* worthwile and commendable, no matter if it's been done many times before or if the quality doesn't compare with the very best. Billions of people have seen the same sun on the horizon, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't snap a picture of my own when I find myself gazing at a beautiful sunset. It'll be different from everyone else's, and more importantly, it'll be my own! So, with such a mindset, I'll try to write more, about things that've already been written about, with style that doesn't compare with that of great essayists, and I'll try not to mind too much!
